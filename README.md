Image Color Analysis for Mineral Identification
This project is a comprehensive web application built with Streamlit that performs image color analysis and edge detection on ore images and give back visual representations like  graphs, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots in a user-friendly downloadable PDF. 
Features:
Image Upload: Users can easily upload rock images for analysis.
Color Detection: The application employs advanced color analysis techniques, including K-means clustering, to identify and visualize the predominant colors in the uploaded image.
Edge Detection: Detects and visualizes the edges in the rock images, enhancing the understanding of rock structure and features.
Visualization Tools: Generates various visual outputs such as pie charts, histograms, and 3D scatter plots to present color distribution.
PDF Report Generation: Users can generate detailed PDF reports that summarize the color analysis and edge detection results, complete with visualizations.
Technologies Used:
Frontend : Streamlit for straight forward web application for professional and another user engaging site for students which is built using Flask
Backend: OpenCV for image processing and color analysis.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib for generating graphs and charts.
Report Generation: ReportLab for creating PDF reports.
Canopy for Edge Detection
Getting Started:
Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Streamlit app with the command streamlit run app.py.
Future Enhancements:
Integrate a machine learning model for automated rock type classification based on color and edge features.
Enhance user interface for better user experience.
Include more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.



*For better experience use the app.py*
